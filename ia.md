Understanding Information Architecture

What was the "big problem" that led to the development of information architecture in the 1990s? Be specific.
Websites weren't planned to host a large number of users, incurring challenges such as usability and findability disasters, content management nightmares and costly redesigns.
Information architects design websites, software and interactive services. IA works to improve various qualities of the user experience, including accessibility, findability, usability, desirability, credibility.  

What was the effect of adding search to websites? How does this differ from the way you may have looked at websites before starting this course?
SEO and search functions shifted attention from home pages to the design of findable, social objects. This caused multiple avenues to reach the same destination, making UX and IA more complex.

What does it mean to say that an information architect is a "bridge builder"? What kinds of bridges do information architects build?
Designing good UX rrequires more than designing sitemaps to enable easy work flow between devices, but also understand the user experience through on-offline work. This requires the Information Architect to use the customer experience to define the structure of the organisational structure. Architects are bridge-builders between the customer and the organisation, the way the organisation is structured and the function of the product.

What is the IA mindset?
The IA mindset is focussed on empathy for the customer as a way of delivering business outcomes. The end-user can be defined in more ways than just the customer, as the employees of all levels of an organisation are also users of the structure and model of a business.

What is PACE layering?
PACE layering differentiates between forces of influence within a business model, mapped against how much leverage or power the part has over the business. Below are the layers, from least powerful but fast, to most powerful but slow moving:
Fashion (the way in which action is taken)
Commerce (the account balance)
Infratructure (the relationships between functions)
Governance (the accountability model)
Culture (the ethic and value of the individuals within the organisation)
Nature (the unexamined assumptions of the individuals)
