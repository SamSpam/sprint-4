Interaction design

The Interaction Design Association (IxDA) explains:

"Interaction designers strive to create useful and usable products and services. Following the fundamental tenets of user-centered design, the practice of interaction design is grounded in an understanding of real users—their goals, tasks, experiences, needs, and wants. Approaching design from a user-centered perspective, while endeavoring to balance users’ needs with business goals and technological capabilities, interaction designers provide solutions to complex design challenges, and define new and evolving interactive products and services."

What is the difference between IxD and UX?
Interaction design, like user experience design, has evolved to facilitate interactions between people and their environment. Unlike user experience design, which accounts for all user-facing aspects of a software or system, interaction designers are (typically) only concerned with the interaction between users and computers. This niche is referred to as human-computer interaction.

What is goal-driven design? (GDD) Check the resources below for an excellent presentation on GDD if you have time.
Goal-driven design is creating a product with the goals and needs of the end-user in mind.

What does it mean to say that "the best interaction designs don’t exist"?
This refers to the idea that users shouldn't have to think or know about the design intended behind an interaction or online process. To the user, it doesn't exist.

Remind us again, what's an "affordance"? And what do you think a "bad affordance" might be? Can you think of any examples in the physical world?
Affordances are points of interactions between an actor and their environment. For example, a chair affords a place to sit, as does a lone rock in a desert. Online, affordances are things like buttons, links and search boxes. It is argued that these affordances should be designed in such a way that the actor is invited to use it. This requires a familiarity and ease of use.

Under what circumstance should interaction designers take great effort in making that interface learnable? What kinds of knowledge and skills do they need to do this?
Interaction should, to the best possible extent, use established design conventions to enable web interaction. If their product or design problem calls for a truly unique interaction, then the focus should be on developing an easily learnable interface. This requires a strong knowledge of current design conventions, affordances and overall web usabilty.

What do you think one of the hardest parts of being an interaction designer is? Do you think this applies to full-stack web developers as well?
According to the author of this article, one of the hardest jobs of the interaction designer is keeping up with the speed of change in the industry. My realively uninformed opinion is that another of the hardest parts would be to work with the web developers and associated clients to encourage them to take your suggested measures to improve interactivity inn whatever way - this would involve facilitation, communication and piles of empathy :).
