She's referring to domain level duplicate content, whereby website content is served following different URLs. In her example case, the author uses the 'www.' and 'http(s)' to denote different domain names, pointing to the same content.

What is crawl budget and why is it important to your website?
A crawl budget is the amount of links that a googlebot will follow to search for relevant content before stopping. This exists because the googlebot consumes energy, which is a cost to Google.
