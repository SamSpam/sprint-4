Three websites and their accessibility:

http://www.generationzero.org/
The Generation Zero Website, one which I've been involved in creating, misses some key aspects to enale it to be accessible. For example, it doesn't state which human language the site is in, 18 images don't have an 'alt' attribute and the contrast ratio on many text elements are insufficient.

http://www.scarecrow.co.nz/
The Scarecrow site which I also created has less significant problems. Perhaps because it's built on Squarespace which is more fail-proof. Probles include not having clear indication for link purpose.

https://www.zomato.com/
Nominally, Zomato has more errors than the other pages, but the errors are not as significant. Such as, pages are given the human language, and images have an alt name. However, some of the same errors occurred, such as not having clear links.
