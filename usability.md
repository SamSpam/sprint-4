# Usability

The overall message of using placeholder text is basically not to. For a variety of reasons. There are also varying degrees of unhelpfulness that placeholders can have. For example, a placeholder in a form which is intended to replace the separate instruction is worse than one which has both the instruction and the placeholder. The key problem here is that once the user has clicked to fill it out, they may forget what the field was for, or when going back to check over they will need to know the use.
This clearly suggests that although placeholders are a fancy trick, they don't actually help the user perform a task overall.

Preventing user error

Users make errors due to design fault, not user fault. The two types of fault are slips and mistakes. The way in which forms are designed either allow or remove possible sources of error.

Tactics used to enable success include having helpful constraints, offering suggestions, choosing good defaults and using forgiving formatting.
